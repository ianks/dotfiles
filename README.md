# Ian's Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfile repo! You'll notice there is only one file here; that's
because this repo is a simple bootstrap script which uses
[`yadm`](https://yadm.io/) to install the [*real* dotfiles](https://github.com/ianks/dotfiles-repo).

## Installing

```sh
curl -o- -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ianks/dotfiles/master/install.sh | sh
```
